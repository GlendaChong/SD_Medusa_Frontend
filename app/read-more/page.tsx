                    Medusa was developed to address a fundamental challenge: making the NFS's diverse range of projects, particularly in machine learning and blockchain, available to any interested party in an integrated platform.

                <p className="font-extralight text-h4-s mb-12">
                    The project's essence was to transform the way these services were showcased - from mere articles and Github repositories to a fully interactive digital experience.

                        The society recognised the need to transition from traditional showcases to a more integrated experience. This change was not just about impressing sponsors and the public but also about enhancing user engagement with the societyâ€™s projects. The goal was to create a customisable, scalable, and user-friendly platform.

                        The choice of a microservice architecture enabled the independent deployment of each service, ensuring scalability and flexibility. With future expansions in mind, this architecture promised an evolving platform that could adapt to changing needs and technologies.

                        The project was divided into four major milestones, each marking a significant phase in the development process:

                                Initially, the Design Manager's input was pivotal in establishing the aesthetic foundation of Medusa. Utilising Figma, the design team crafted the initial colour scheme and essential UI components, including navigation bars and buttons. The tech team was briefed on the project specificities as well as the frameworks to be used in development.

                                Following the Figma design, the Tech team translated the mockups into a static Next.js web application. Thereafter, functionality was incrementally added, such as a contact form, and user sign ups and authentication.

                                This phase saw further collaboration between design and development teams. The tech team worked out the deployment process for the projects, which involved dockerising repositories of interest, pushing to AWS ECR, and deploying on Fargate. The design team continued their iterative wireframing and prototyping to hone user experience on the frontend.
